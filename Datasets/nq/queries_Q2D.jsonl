Foundation trusts are able to make their own decisions about how to run their services, including setting their own prices and budgets, and are accountable to their patients and the public rather than the Department of Health. In exchange for this greater autonomy, foundation trusts are required to meet certain standards of quality and efficiency, and are subject to regular inspections and assessments by the Care Quality Commission. Foundation trusts are also eligible to retain any surplus funds they generate, rather than having to return them to the Department of Health.

{"_id": "test531", "text": "why is bronze preferred over copper metal for making statues ?\n\nBronze is a popular material for making statues because it has several advantages over copper. One of the main reasons is that bronze is more durable than copper. Bronze is an alloy of copper and tin, and the addition of tin to copper makes it more resistant to corrosion and wear. This means that bronze statues can last for centuries without deteriorating, while copper statues may corrode or tarnish over time.\n\nAnother reason why bronze is preferred over copper for making statues is that it has a richer, more golden color than copper. Bronze has a distinctive warm, yellowish hue that is prized for its aesthetic appeal. This makes bronze statues more visually striking and pleasing to the eye than copper statues,", "metadata": {}}

Additionally, the ability of electrons to move freely within the metal lattice allows for the transfer of electricity, making metals excellent conductors.

As you move closer to the poles, the curvature of the Earth becomes more pronounced, leading to greater distortion. At the North Pole, for example, the meridians are stretched out and appear to be nearly parallel to each other, which can make it difficult to accurately represent the shape of the Earth. Similarly, at the South Pole, the meridians are also stretched out, but they are also rotated 90 degrees clockwise from their true position, which can lead to further distortion.

When a bullet is fired, it travels in a straight line until it encounters air resistance, which causes it to slow down and drop towards the ground.

Terminal velocity is the maximum speed at which an object falls through the air, and it is determined by the object's weight and the air resistance it encounters. When a bullet is fired into the air, it initially travels at a high speed due to its momentum.
